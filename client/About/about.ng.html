<h3>About this site</h3>
<p class="text-warning">
	Disclaimer: This is not professional work. It's build in fast development with no prior experience about MeteorJs. I'm aware of the <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide" target="_blank">styleguides</a>.
</p>
<p class="text-info">
	The profile image upload size is restricted: The meteor server hasn't installed graphicsmagick and so the images can't be cropped and downsized automatically.
</p>
<p>
The creator of this "app" wanted to see how long it'd take him to make his own <a href="https://www.spocal.net" target="_blank">Spocal</a>. He had no prior knowledge of angularJs or meteorJs and learned everything while doing this.
</p>
	<h4>There are features missing!</h4>
<p>
Yes. Some (bigger) features from the original Spocal are missing: Notification emails and an android/ios app (<del>however this site is also built for mobiles</del> will be revised). <br>There are also smaller features missing (user activity, edit posts/comments, more user data etc.), but these can be added easily.
</p>
	<h4>It doesn't look that nice</h4>
<p>
Unfortunately yes. I was primary concerned with operational things. I'm open to concrete suggestions for improvement. The site uses bootstrap and can change the whole appearance by switching template.
</p>
	<h4>Why are there no tests?</h4>
<p>
I usually write unit tests: I tried three different packages/ways to make tests work. The best I found is sanjo:jasmine package for meteor, which looks pretty promising. However, after googling the third bug (having strange errors which come and go without changing anything; not loading the altered test file, you have to restart to server etc.), I gave up. I'd really like to add tests, but at the moment it already took me too much time to get started.
</p>
	<h4>Why AngularJs and MeteorJs?</h4>
<p>
I was recommended to take a serious look to both frameworks. This little project seemed predestined for this matter. While developing the app, I run across some issues:
<ul>
	<li>The longer I work with it... I start to disklike publish/subscribe and want to go back to the classical API. Handling relations is pain and I simply don't want my client to handle with 10'000 rows where not even 100 are needed. The solution to this (according to stack overflow) is to make more meteor methods on the server, which is a bit a messy solution in my opinion.</li>
	<li>I find it difficult to follow standards/ways how some problems are solved: Either there are none or they're hard to find.</li>
	<li>Lazy-loading hasn't settled in angularJs (however, there are plugins which add this).</li>
	<li>Having a lot of callbacks because of asynchronity; what I need is to go on when all subscribtions are ready, not to wait for subscribtion 1, then subscribe to 2, then... etc. It's surely possible somehow.</li>
	<li>Comming from abstract languages like Python and Scala, I was surprised how much effort some basic things need: Like trying to group elements in a mongodb collection (aggregate with observer support isn't yet supported by meteor).</li>
</ul>
Most of these problems may go away with more experience.

	<h4>Working schedule</h4>
<p>
5 soirées à 3-5 heures + some more time for tidying up
</p>
	<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
Some solutions are not satisfying: The anonymous profiles (2 collections) and normal users (1 collection) could have been put in one collection. My solution distinguishes the two, thus has a clean user collection, but the model is a bit confusing. And then one has always to subscribe to 3 collections to work with users & profiles.<br>
- I like the frameworks; it's easier to develop a "reactive" app and MeteorJs saves some work.<br>
However I would not recommend to use MeteorJs in production since the API changes a lot. Tutorials not working (because smth changed), dependencies of packages installing things twice etc., it's just not grown up.
