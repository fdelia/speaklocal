# ${1:Speak Local(ly)}

An imitation of the old [spocal.net](http://www.spocal.net).
It's unfinished work: It has more or less "full" functionality, but isn't scalable and some things are missing (e.g. good error handling).
I uploaded it [here](http://speaklocal.meteor.com). However, the server of speaklocal.meteor.com is free and very slow.

## Installation

* Download files
* Install meteor
* In main folder start the server with `meteor`
* Go to http://localhost:3000

## Usage

...

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
